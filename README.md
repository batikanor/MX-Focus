Here's a sample README for the project:

## EEG Calmness 

The project consists of the following key components:
1. **Muse Headband**: A wearable EEG device that captures real-time brainwave signals.
2. **MuseLSL (Muse Labs Streamer)**: Software that streams EEG data from the Muse Headband in real-time using the Lab Streaming Layer (LSL) protocol.
3. **AWS IoT Core**: Cloud service for securely transmitting EEG data from the MuseLSL to the cloud for further processing.
4. **Scikit-learn Model**: A machine learning model trained to analyze EEG data and classify the user's calmness based on the frequency bands of the brainwaves.
5. **API Gateway**: AWS API Gateway is used to expose the calmness score as a REST API, making it accessible for external applications (web, mobile).

### High-Level Workflow
The process flows as follows:
1. The **User** wears the **Muse Headband**, which records EEG signals.
2. **MuseLSL** streams the EEG data in real-time to **AWS IoT Core**.
3. **AWS IoT Core** sends the data to a **Scikit-learn** model for processing.
4. The model generates a **calmness score** based on the EEG data.
5. The calmness score is exposed via **AWS API Gateway** and can be retrieved by external applications.

## How It Works

### 1. Muse Headband
- **Muse Headband** is a wearable EEG device that records brainwave signals in real-time.
- It measures various brainwave frequencies like Alpha, Beta, Theta, and Gamma waves.

### 2. MuseLSL (Muse Labs Streamer)
- **MuseLSL** is a tool that facilitates the streaming of EEG data from the Muse Headband via the **Lab Streaming Layer (LSL)** protocol.
- It allows real-time data collection and transmission to external systems or cloud services like AWS.

### 3. AWS IoT Core
- **AWS IoT Core** is used to securely handle and transmit the EEG data from MuseLSL to the cloud.
- Data from MuseLSL is sent via **MQTT protocol** to AWS IoT Core for real-time processing and analysis.

### 4. Calmness Model (Scikit-learn)
- **Scikit-learn** is used to process the EEG data and generate the calmness score.
- The model classifies brainwave activity into categories (calm vs. not calm) based on the frequency bands.
- It uses machine learning models trained on EEG data to predict calmness.

### 5. Calmness Score API
- The calmness score is made available through a RESTful API, exposed via **AWS API Gateway**.
- External applications (e.g., mobile apps or web apps) can make HTTP requests to this API to retrieve the calmness score in real-time.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Muse Headband Setup
- Pair the Muse Headband with your computer using Bluetooth.
- Install MuseLSL on your system to enable data streaming from the Muse Headband.

### 2. Install MuseLSL
Follow the installation instructions in the [MuseLSL repository](https://github.com/muse-lsl/MuseLSL) to stream data from the Muse Headband. Ensure that the EEG data is streaming to a local server or cloud destination.

### 3. AWS IoT Core Setup
- Set up an **AWS IoT Core** instance to securely handle incoming data.
- Configure AWS IoT Core to receive and process the EEG data stream via MQTT.
- Create and manage **Things** (representing the Muse Headband) within AWS IoT Core.

### 4. Model Training & Inference
- Train a machine learning model using **Scikit-learn** on a dataset of EEG signals to classify calmness based on brainwave frequencies.
- Deploy the trained model on **AWS Lambda** or an **EC2 instance** for inference.

### 5. Exposing Calmness Score via API
- Set up **AWS API Gateway** to expose the calmness score as a REST API.
- Integrate AWS Lambda with API Gateway to generate and serve the calmness score.
